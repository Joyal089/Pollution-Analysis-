1️⃣ Define Your Objective  
- What insights do you want to derive?  
  ✅ Identify PM2.5 pollution trends over time.  
  ✅ Find peak pollution periods.  
  ✅ Suggest actionable insights for emission control.  


2️⃣ Collect Data  
You mentioned using EPA AQS and OpenAQ, so you’ll need to:  
-EPA AQS Data: Download from [EPA AQS Data Mart](https://www.epa.gov/aqs) or use the API.  
-OpenAQ Data: Access via [OpenAQ API](https://docs.openaq.org/) or download CSV files.  

📌 Tools Needed: 
✅ Python (requests, pandas)  
✅ API Keys (if required)  

Example API Call (OpenAQ) in Python:  
python
import requests

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
After fetching data, clean and preprocess it.  

Common Steps:  
✅ Remove missing/null values  
✅ Convert timestamps to datetime format  
✅ Filter data for relevant locations & time periods  
✅ Handle duplicates  


4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Now, visualize and understand trends.  

✅ Check Data Distribution (Histograms, Boxplots)  
✅ Find Peak Pollution Days (Rolling Averages)  
✅ Compare Locations  



5️⃣ Identify Peak Pollution Periods  
- Find days with highest PM2.5 values  
- Use rolling averages to detect trends  


6️⃣ Insights & Recommendations  
- Identify seasonal trends (e.g., winter vs. summer pollution levels)  
- Highlight cities/regions with worst pollution  
- Suggest actionable steps (e.g., emission reduction policies)  

7️⃣ Present Results  
📌 Options:  
✅ Jupyter Notebook Report  
✅ Interactive Dashboard (Tableau, Power BI, Plotly)  
✅ Research Paper/Blog Post
